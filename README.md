# Multi-Container Pod Design Patterns in Kubernetes



Multi-container pods are extremely useful for specific purposes in Kubernetes. While itâ€™s not always necessary to combine multiple containers into a single pod, knowing the right patterns to adopt creates more robust Kubernetes deployments.



- [Sidecar pattern](https://github.com/ishubhoshaha/k8-pattarn/tree/main/sidecar): An extra container in your pod to enhance or extend the functionality of the main container.
- [Ambassador pattern](https://github.com/ishubhoshaha/k8-pattarn/tree/main/ambassador): A container that proxy the network connection to the main container.
- [Adapter pattern](https://github.com/ishubhoshaha/k8-pattarn/tree/main/adapter): A container that transform output of the main container.
